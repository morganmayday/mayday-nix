Heyo! I'm Morgan Mayday, this is my customized NixOS & Hyprland config. Version number: 0.3.2-cinnamon-stable.

TODO: Write a proper setup script.

#### Install Instructions: Fresh
From a fresh NixOS ISO, begin by going through the base setup process. The only things that will continue to matter are your **partitioning**, your **hostname**, and your **username**--we'll overwrite everything but the partitioning scheme, and your hostname and username break things weird if they're different from what you'll put in this dotfile set.
